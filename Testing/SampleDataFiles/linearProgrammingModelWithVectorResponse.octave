%solve the optimization: (code copied from nf.m)
LB=zeros(numArcs,1);
if useOctave

	[xopt fval exitflag] = glpk(c,A,b, LB,[],ctype);
else
	[xopt fval exitflag] = linprog(c,[],[],A,b, LB);

%and display the classification: which of the output arcs took the flow
disp(xopt); %Outputs vector of all nodes that were hit
